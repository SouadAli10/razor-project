                    <p>Razor's focus is emerging markets with direct access into opportunities in South Asia and the Middle East. Razor's access comes through reputable relationships with individuals and institutions which help in vetting and identifying opportunities.
                        The founders of Razor are based in London, Beirut, and Dhaka and benefit from a cross-continent network. This creates a unique opportunity for western capital to meet eastern opportunities.</p>
